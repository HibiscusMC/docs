Installing HMCRewards is simple, however you are required to install HibiscusCommons, which is freely available in our Discord Server.

After installing HibiscusCommons and HMCRewards, you can now use one of our provided configurations for ItemsAdder or Oraxen,
or you can use the default configuration files for a fresh start.
