# Setup

Installing **HMCRewards** is simple, however you are required to install HibiscusCommons, which is freely available in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pcm8kWrdNt).

After installing HibiscusCommons and HMCRewards, you can now use one of our provided configurations for ItemsAdder or Oraxen,
or you can use the default configuration files for a fresh start.
