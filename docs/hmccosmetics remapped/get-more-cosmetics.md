# Get More Cosmetics


Hibiscus Creative Studios sells tons of cosmetic packs on [MCModels.net](https://mcmodels.net/vendors/hibiscus-studios-store/), which you can purchase.

Most of our older products only include a MCCosmetics Configuration, but if you purchase an older product and would like a configuration for HMCC you can open a ticket and we can create one.
