## Plugin Description

HMCLeaves allows custom leaves, logs and saplings to be placed in the world. This also means
that transparent block textures can be used for custom blocks.

## How it Works

The plugin works by sending fake block states to the client in order for them to
see the custom texture, while also allowing leaves to decay as normal because the server-side
blocks are not changed.
