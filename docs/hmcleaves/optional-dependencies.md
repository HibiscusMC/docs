### How to Use
1. For any item that you wish to use an Item Hook on, all you have to do is make the item id of 
the HMCLeaves item and the Item Hook the same.
2. You can then obtain the item with the [HMCLeaves command] or the Item Hook command.

####Example:
```yaml
logs:
  # This is the id of the HMCLeaves item *and* the Item Hook item
  pine_log:
    log-material: OAK_LOG
    stripped-log-material: STRIPPED_OAK_LOG
```
