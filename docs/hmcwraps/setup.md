# Setup

HMCWraps has no dependencies. The plugin does have optional [Hooks](https://docs.hibiscusmc.com/docs/hmcwraps/hooks), which use other plugins, but you do not need anything else installed to use the plugin.

## Vanilla Resource Pack

Add the resource pack to your server using server.properties

## ItemsAdder

Coming soon!

## Oraxen

Coming soon!

After installing, we recommend modifying the message.properties file to your liking using [MiniMessage Formatting](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html).

Then, you can read the default configs and start adding your wraps!
