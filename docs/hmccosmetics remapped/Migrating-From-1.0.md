# Migrating from HMCCosmetics 1.0

Remapped is a full recode from 1.0. Because of this, there are a lot of changes to the plugin configuration scheme.

## Cosmetic Configurations

Cosmetics are now configured inside of a cosmetic file within the `cosmetics` folder. You can create as many cosmetic files as you want, but each cosmetic file (and cosmetic name) must be unique.

You can see an example configuration for a cosmetic on the [Cosmetic Types](https://docs.hibiscusmc.com/hmccosmetics%20remapped/Cosmetic-Types) page.

## Menu Configuration

In 1.0, cosmetics & menus are combined into one file. Now, menus are configured inside of the `menus` folder.

## Dyeable Cosmetics

Dyeable cosmetics still function within Remapped, although, it requires the HMCColor Plugin. You can download it [here](https://polymart.org/resource/hmccolor.2831).
